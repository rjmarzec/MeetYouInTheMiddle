        Hi there!\n\n
        This is Meet You In The Middle, an app meant to bring nearby friends, groupmates, and all other
        kinds of people together for the purpose of meeting up to hang out or work on some project
        at a location that is fair for everyone.\n\n
        To start, enter in at least 2 addresses and start the search. The map will then direct you
        to a spot that is equidistant from each person. From there, click one of the icons in the
        bottom right to open the location in google maps and look around for a place that
        looks good, and plan out your route.\n\n
        This app was designed and created by Robert Marzec for Lane Tech\'s 2018 CS Fair. If you have
        any comments, questions, or concerns, please email me at rjmarzec@cps.edu.
