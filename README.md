# MeetYouInTheMiddle
Hi there!

This is Meet You In The Middle, an Android app meant to bring nearby friends, groupmates, and all other
kinds of people together for the purpose of meeting up to hang out or work on some project
at a location that is 'fair' for everyone.

To start, enter in at least 2 addresses and start the search. The map will then direct you
to a spot that is equidistant from each person. From there, click one of the icons in the
bottom right to open the location in google maps and look around for a place that
looks good, and plan out your route. 

This app was designed and created by Robert Marzec for Lane Tech's 2018 CS Fair. If you have
any comments, questions, or concerns, please email me at rjmarzec@cps.edu.
